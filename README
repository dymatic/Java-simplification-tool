#History
This tool originated as a standard deviation calculator. (And as a quick side note, I was using the wrong formula.)
LibMath didn't make it nearly as far as the text library has at the time of writing this README. The text library started off as a practical set of methods for extracting and handling text, but eventually became focused around text scrambling. The LibVarious class began after LibMath and LibText

#Future plans
I hope to take the project in a new direction, adding some tools for really simple tasks that will just shorten code. I know it makes code harder to read if it uses the tools, so I will be trying my best in naming the methods in a self-describing way.

#Using the tool
Just import the code to your project and go. The methods are all static, so you'll have to use the class name rather than instantiating.
