This is my first project on Github and I'm relatively new to Git as a whole, so I apologize for any mistakes or convention breakings.

  3) Using the tool

#History
This tool originated as a standard deviation calculator. (And as a quick sidenote, I was using the wrong formula.)
The mathematic library didn't make it nearly as far as the text library has at the time of writing this README. The text library started off as a practical set of methods for extracting and handling text, but eventaully became focused around text scrambling.

#Future plans
I hope to take the project in a new direction, adding some tools for really simple tasks that will just shorten code. I know it makes code harder to read if it uses the tools, so I will be trying my best in naming the methods in a self-describing way.

#Using the tool
<<<<<<< HEAD
Just import the code to your project and start using it. All of the Text methods are static and all of the mathematics ones are not, I will be doing my best to change that inconsistancy.
=======
Just import the code to your project and start using it. All of the methods are static, so you need to use Classname.method() rather than instantination.
