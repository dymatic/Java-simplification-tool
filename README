#History
⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉
This tool originated as a standard deviation calculator. (And as a quick side note, I was using the wrong formula.)
LibMath was originally called MathematicsResourceLibrary, a real pain to type out since it has static methods. The TextResourceLibrary, the next class in LibSubject,
was added before the renaming.

#Future plans
⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉
I hope to make more of the javadoc agree, rename some of the methods, and possibly create a program that will utilize the various methods.

#Using the tool
⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉⑉
Just import the code to your project and go. The methods are all static, so you'll have to use the class name rather than instantiating. The files do
not contain a main class, but read #Future plans, because a future update may bring an executable version of these files.
